# Stan pkgdown Configuration <a href="https://visruthsk.github.io/Stan_pkgdown_config"><img src="man/figures/logo.svg" align="right" height="139" alt="pkgdownConfig website" /></a>

Built in the vein of [quarto-config](https://github.com/stan-dev/quarto-config).

Styling for Stan sites built with pkgdown. Do not use this theme in a non-Stan package.

[Source](https://github.com/VisruthSK/Stan_pkgdown_config/). The contributed package is called `pkgdownConfig`, but the repository has Stan in the name to make it explicit that this is a Stan project.

## How to Use

See the vignette.
