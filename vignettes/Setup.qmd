In `./_pkgdown.yml` add the contributed package:

```yaml
template:
  package: pkgdownConfig
```

Point to this repository in `DESCRIPTION` to download the theme automatically.

```yaml
Config/Needs/website: VisruthSK/pkgdownConfig
```

If for some reason the favicons don't build, find logo.svg in your build directory, and run `pkgdown::build_favicons($PATH_TO_LOGO)` once to build the favicons.

Note that the favicons and logo should be copied into your build directory and ideally should be hooked in automatically. If you can't find the logo, you can download it from [here](https://github.com/stan-dev/logos/blob/master/hex_stickers/stan_hex_cut.svg) and follow the same steps above.

If you want the hex in your README, edit the `README.MD`. You can take a look at this package's to get an idea of what you need to do (repeated below):

```md
# pkgdownConfig <a href="https://visruthsk.github.io/pkgdownConfig"><img src="man/figures/logo.svg" align="right" height="139" alt="pkgdownConfig website" /></a>
```

For any further concerns/help/anything, open an issue and/or ping me on the Stan Slack.
