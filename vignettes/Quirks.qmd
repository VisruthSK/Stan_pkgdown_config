Due to how the theme is written, there are some thing you should note.

## Templates

This theme uses partials to override the default templates for the navbar and for `head`. These are both pinned at a [specific commit](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/tree/fe04924b3df129bea60ac871614b01d87bcae147). If you notice that the theme is behind upstream, please open an issue.

### before-title

Since the theme overrides the navbar partial to insert the logo, anything HTML put in `before-title` will appear before the logo.

``` yaml
template:
  includes:
    # before_title_AND_LOGO
    before_title: |
      My_cool_html
```

I left the functionality in so that the website wouldn't fail silently and eat your input, but I hazard that you won't want to put anything before the logo. If you want to put things in `before_title` you should copy my `navbar.HTML` into your package's pkgdown configuration and edit it, putting HTML where it says `{{#includes}}{{{before_navbar}}}{{/includes}}`.

## Logs Say Image Missing

This template copies over the Stan hex logo to root and references that manually in the templates, which `pkgdown` doens't like. As such, you'll get errors like

```         
Missing images in .github/CONTRIBUTING.md: logo.png
â„¹ pkgdown can only use images in man/figures and vignettes
```

If you actually navigate to that page the logo will be there. I may fix/change this by referencing man/figures/logo (which is also copied over).
