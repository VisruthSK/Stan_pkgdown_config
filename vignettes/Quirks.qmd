Due to how the theme is written, there are some thing you should note.

This theme uses partials to override the default templates for the navbar and for `head`. These are both pinned at a [specific commit](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/tree/fe04924b3df129bea60ac871614b01d87bcae147). If you notice that the theme is behind upstream, please open an issue.

Since the theme overrides the navbar partial to insert the logo, anything HTML put in `before-title` will appear before the logo.

``` yaml
template:
  includes:
    # before_title_AND_LOGO
    before_title: |
      My_cool_html
```
I left this in so that the website wouldn't fail silently and eat your input, but I hazard that you won't want to put anything here.
